# Toolkit instructions

The toolkit is useful for getting the corresponding label map for [the PASCAL Part Challenge](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~xiaochen.lian/paspart_challenge/index.html)

For the toolkit, it includes the code translate [PASCAL part data](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~xianjie.chen/pascal_part_dataset/pascal_part.html) into the evaluation semantic part labels. 


For translate the labels: 

 	Download the pascal part from the website and unzip it to trainval folder 
 	(the annotation should be under $PATH/trainval/Annotations_Part). 
 	
	Run $PATH/Toolkit/demo.m to check the examples of mapping the part label annotations to the evaluation part (also the instance bounding boxes). 

For the labels' semantic meaning of the transfered part id map. 

	Run $PATH/Toolkit/LoadPascalPart.m
        The meanning of generated struct is listed as follows: 

	VOCPart.SemPartNames: mapid to semantic part names 
	VOCPart.obj_id: the correspondent semantic class id to the VOC objects. 
	VOCPart.classes: the semantic class name 
	VOCPart.classes_all: original VOC objects names. 

This toolkit is provided and used to generate the results in the following paper:

We will later try to release our model and code, but it might depend on the authors' time.
